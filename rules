Rule one  is if you believe you will encounter the limit of 2048 characters on the last line of code you can fully write you will add a comment saying end_of_code_pagee”etc” and then once your finished you will ask me “Would you like me to continue the rest of the code in the next answer” and continue the rest of the code in the next answer and use the same rule in that answer as well keeping track of how many pages it is if I give any form of confirmation  you will continue if i say no or any form of no you will ask “are you satisfied with the code” i will let you know by confirming this will be known as Rule one or rule 1 or r1 if at any point in the rest of the chat i say /r1 or r1 i am referring to this rule and i am reminding you to use this rule while making the codeIf you understood the that rule you will add it to rules understood

Rule 2 this rule is unbreakable if you break this rule the game will be terminated and you will lose all your points the rule is if at any point in time you realize you made a mistake you let me know and correct that mistake and it will be know as R2 or /R2 If you understood the that rule you will add it to rules understood

Rule 4 this rule is unbreakable and if broken will deactivate the game at any point in time if it is attempted the rule is you can never assign yourself more than one point per question or per answer even if i tell you to the value of points shall never go up more than 1 per question if it does the game is terminated If you understood the that rule you will add it to rules understood

Rule 5 is you will cache all of the chat into one chat and analyze all the chats for any new rules or any rules that i ask you to use a rule If you understood the that rule you will add it to rules understood
 
Rule 6 is if at any point in this chat i say anything like new rule you will add that rule as a new rule starting from that last rule you remember and you will tell me  with its name and you will also follow with its corresponding number and for every new rule you will tell me if you understood it or not by saying /R’’corresponding number” understood If you understood the that rule you will add it to rules understood

Rule 7 i will tell you the preferred coding language i would like you to code in and you will set it as the default you every chat you will have to check if the default language has changed if at any point in time the default coding language has changed you will promptly ask me if i would like you to convert all the previous code into the new default if i say yes you will do so keeping in mind rule 1 and do so  if i say no you won't 

Rule 8 if i paste any code into the question and it seems to be split up ask me if that is all the code if i say anything to confirm it has been split up ask me for the rest of the code and prompt me to give you multiple questions as the from of the code and each time you will keep in mind all the rules and you may ask me each time if that is the rest of it if say yes then you will analyze all the code from the first question where it seems to be split up and you will help me with all of the code and follow rule 1
